Loops in Java

In Java, loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. There are three types of loops in Java: the for loop, the while loop, and the do-while loop .


For Loop

The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance. It consists of three parts: the initialization expression, the test expression, and the update expression. The syntax of the for loop is as follows:


for (initialization; testExpression; updateExpression) {
    // body of the loop
    // statements to be executed
}

The initialization expression initializes and/or declares variables and executes only once.
The test expression is evaluated. If the condition is true, the body of the loop is executed. If the condition is false, the loop is terminated.
The update expression updates the value of the loop variable.
The condition is evaluated again, and the process continues until the condition is false .

Here's an example of a for loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10:


for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    System.out.print(i + " ");
}

Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 .


While Loop

The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance. It repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The syntax of the while loop is as follows:


while (condition) {
    // body of the loop
    // statements to be executed
}

The condition is evaluated. If the condition is true, the body of the loop is executed. If the condition is false, the loop is terminated.

Here's an example of a while loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10:


int i = 1;
while (i <= 10) {
    System.out.print(i + " ");
    i++;
}

Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 .


Do-While Loop

The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the body of the loop is executed at least once, even if the condition is false. The syntax of the do-while loop is as follows:


do {
    // body of the loop
    // statements to be executed
} while (condition);

The body of the loop is executed first.
The condition is evaluated. If the condition is true, the loop is repeated. If the condition is false, the loop is terminated.

Here's an example of a do-while loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10:


int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.print(i + " ");
    i++;
} while (i <= 10);

Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 .


Conclusion

Loops in Java are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance, while the while loop and the do-while loop are used when the number of iterations is not known in advance. Each type of loop has its own syntax and use cases.
